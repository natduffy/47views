<p>Starting with a series of <a href="http://tensecondfilm.com" target="_blank">Ten Second Films</a> that went viral before there
was even an internet, David Wild collaborated with <em>MTV</em> on similar mini-docs.
Focusing on the Midwest, his documentary subjects included an 80-year old knife
thrower, a Mackinac Bridge painter and a fast talking auctioneer.</p>

<p>A graduate of the USC Film School, he started his professional film career as an
animator (<em>Nickelodeon</em>), a music video/documentary editor and as a freelance
sound mixer, but he soon moved into directing.</p>

<img src="img/david-wild-2.jpg" alt="david-wild-2" width="288" height="216" align="right" style="padding-left:15px">
<p>His ability to bring out the best in &ldquo;real&rdquo; people gave him the opportunity to direct
numerous national commercials. Using truth and humor, he won numerous
awards, e.g. Cannes Silver Lions, honors at the London International Film Festival and a nomination for Commercial Director of the Year from the Directors Guild of America. It also made him an ideal music video director for groups such as the
<a href="http://vimeo.com/21847380" target="_blank">Pixies</a> and the <em>Fastbacks</em>, seeking an original voice with which to collaborate.</p>

<p>His <em>MTV</em> music background extends to co-directing the concert film <em>Between
the Teeth</em>, a collaboration with <em>David Byrne</em> (Talking Heads). One reviewer
wrote: &ldquo;By not employing all that standard concert camerawork that cuts according
to syncopation, solo riffs and lighting cues, "Between the Teeth" becomes
something apart from a routine concert film... a document that will stand the test
of time.&rdquo; (Austin Chronicle)</p>

<p>But documentary has remained his first love. In addition to <em>Forty-Seven
Views of Leslie Laskey</em>, Wild directed the short film <a href="https://vimeo.com/15829264" target="_blank">Seventeen People
from Toronto</a>. Described as both whimsical and deeply profound, his film
features interviewees of all ages contemplating aloud everything from their first
kiss to what will happen after they die.</p>

<p>As a high school teenager, <a href="http://www.luluwild.com/" target="_blank">Lulu Gargiulo</a> had two passions: horses and rock n&rsquo;
roll. She combined both in her still photography, snapping pictures at rodeos,
racetracks, music clubs and sports arenas.</p>

<p>From there, she graduated to filmmaking, becoming a camera assistant (Carroll
Ballard&rsquo;s <em>The Nutcracker</em>) and operator (Comedy Central&rsquo;s <em>Reno 911</em>)
and eventually a commercial DP and Cinematographer. As a shooter, she&rsquo;s
worked on hundreds of commercials and music videos and is known for her hard
work ethics and passion for a project.</p>

<p>In addition to shooting commercials, Lulu's documentary work includes the PBS
mini-series, <em>The Meaning of Food</em>, the short film <a href="https://vimeo.com/15829264" target="_blank">Seventeen People
from Toronto</a>, and the Emmy winning PBS short, <em>The Crossing Guard</em>.
She has done additional camerawork on <em>Hype</em>, <em>The Jim Rose Sideshow</em>,
<em>Pearl Jam</em> and <em>Alice in Chains</em> live concerts. <em>(Photo credit: Niffer Calderwood)</em></p>

<p>Among her credits for nonprofit agencies are shoots for the Nisqually Tribe, the
Faith Trust Institute, the United Way and the Committee for Children. <em>Check It
Out</em> and <em>Got 2 Come Up</em> have both won awards, including regional EMMY's.</p>

<p>Her narrative work includes <em>The Collectors</em> (Best Drama LATV FEST), <em>The
Year of My Japanese Cousin</em> (PBS drama), and <em>Spare Me</em> (SIFF Fly
Film).</p>

<p>When not making films, Lulu has played the guitar as a member of Seattle punk
band, the <a href="http://www.subpop.com/artists/fastbacks" target="_blank">Fastbacks</a>. For over 20 years, the Fastbacks have performed
around the US, Japan and Europe, touring with bands such as Pearl Jam and
Presidents of the United States of America.</p>

<p>Lulu is currently is working on the documentary <a href="http://vimeo.com/15371310" target="_blank">Howdy Pardner&mdash;Tales of
the Cowboy Hat</a>, co-produced with director, David Wild.</p>

<h3 style="height:192px; padding-top:40px"><img src="img/dennis.jpg" alt="dennis" width="288" height="185" align="left" style="padding-right:15px">Dennis Cope<br/><br/> Co-Producer</h3>   

<p>Dennis Cope is a somewhat-retired architect focusing on senior-living as his favorite project type. After more than a decade of managing offices for HOK in Tokyo and Seattle, he began his single-practitioner firm in order to concentrate solely and in the quiet of his Seattle home on those projects, primarily located in the Tokyo area.</p>

<p>Returning to St. Louis in 2008 after an absence of 17 years, his occasional consulting work on projects for the elderly provides additional time for traveling as well as volunteer pursuits such as mentoring and alumni teaching at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>

<p>Reconnecting with Professor Leslie Laskey, his challenging teacher in 1962 and 1968, has led to various projects for <em>Studio L</em> where he is a board member, including assisting in the final steps of bringing <em>47 Views of Leslie Laskey</em> to the screen.</p>
