      If you define an artist as one who doesn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;make art&rdquo; but is someone who has
      an insatiable curiosity toward the world, whose vision is strong but ever evolving
      and who lives their art everyday, then you are describing Leslie Laskey.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Painter, sculptor, photographer, poet, teacher, mentor, cook, friend Leslie
      approaches all such roles with the mindfulness of a true artist taking nothing for
      granted, challenging himself and others, making every experience an opportunity
      to both learn and teach.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      One might imagine this approach was set in motion when at the age of
      seventeen, he participated in <strong>Orson Welles&rsquo; War of the Worlds</strong> radio
      broadcast. Or perhaps it was distilled in 1944, when as a soldier of the Second
      World War he stormed the beaches of Normandy. It was certainly refined at the
      Institute of Design where he studied under American Bauhaus pioneer, <strong><a href="http://www.moholy-nagy.eu/" target="_blank">L&aacute;szl&oacute;
      Moholy-Nagy</a></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      For 35 years at Washington University&rsquo;s School of Architecture, Professor
      Laskey influenced thousands of first year design students. Sometimes in
      profound and life changing ways. But he was always open to study and learning
      from others and encouraged the collaboration of ideas. He found a kinship and
      spiritual father in <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikō_Munakata" target="_blank">Shik&#333; Munakata</a></strong>, the internationally acclaimed Japanese
      woodblock artist.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      His legacy is firmly rooted and continues to grow. In 1987, he was named
      Professor Emeritus and in 2006, a group of former students founded <strong><a href="http://studiolaskey.com/index.html
" target="_blank">Studio L</a></strong>,
      an organization that sponsors the &ldquo;Laskey Award,&rdquo; a design competition, whose
      mission is to foster and honor Professor Laskey&rsquo;s teaching ethic.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Neither retirement nor age have affected Laskey&rsquo;s modus operandi. He
      continues to teach &ldquo;Art Kamp&rdquo; and his output of &ldquo;art,&rdquo; whether it be the
      presentation of a uniquely &ldquo;Laskey&rdquo; meal or a major gallery opening, is still his
      life.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Leslie continues to work, live, love and inspire, sharing his life with his partner
      of over fifty years, sculptor and architect Frank Schwaiger. He divides his time
      between St Louis and Manistee, Michigan.

      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;I don't think my art is different from my life; they're intertwined, inseparable. The way I cook, the way I paint, the way I read, and the music I listen to are all one in the same.&rdquo;<br/><br/>
