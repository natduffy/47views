    	<h3>David Wild, Director/Editor</h3>
<p>Starting with a series of <strong><a href="http://tensecondfilm.com" target="_blank">Ten Second Films</a></strong> that went viral before there
was even an internet, David Wild collaborated with <strong>MTV</strong> on similar mini-docs.
Focusing on the Midwest, his documentary subjects included an 80-year old knife
thrower, a Mackinac Bridge painter and a fast talking auctioneer.</p>

<p>A graduate of the USC Film School, he started his professional film career as an
animator (<strong>Nickelodeon</strong>), a music video/documentary editor and as a freelance
sound mixer, but he soon moved into directing.</p>

<p>His ability to bring out the best in &ldquo;real&rdquo; people gave him the opportunity to direct
numerous national commercials. Using truth and humor, he won numerous
awards, e.g. the Cannes Lion and honors at the London International Film
Festival. It also made him an ideal music video director for groups such as the
<strong>Pixies</strong> and the <strong>Fastbacks</strong>, seeking an original voice with which to collaborate.</p>

<p>His <strong>MTV</strong> music background extends to co-directing the concert film <strong>Between
the Teeth</strong>, a collaboration with <strong>David Byrne</strong> (Talking Heads). One reviewer
wrote: &ldquo;By not employing all that standard concert camerawork that cuts according
to syncopation, solo riffs and lighting cues, "Between the Teeth" becomes
something apart from a routine concert film….a document that will stand the test
of time.&rdquo; (Austin Chronicle)</p>

<p>But documentary has remained his first love. In addition to <strong>Forty-Seven
Views of Leslie Laskey</strong>, Wild directed the short film <strong>Seventeen People
from Toronto</strong>. Described as both whimsical and deeply profound, his film
features interviewees of all ages contemplating aloud everything from their first
kiss to what will happen after they die.</p>

<p>David is currently working on <strong><a href="http://vimeo.com/15371310" target="_blank">Howdy Pardner&mdash;Tales of the Cowboy
Hat</a></strong>, a documentary film that chronicles the rise, the fall and rise again of a
uniquely American icon, viewed around the world as a symbol of the courage and
independence of the American spirit.</p>

<h3>Lulu Gargiulo, Producer/Cinematographer</h3>

<p>As a high school teenager, Lulu Gargiulo had two passions: horses and rock n&rsquo;
roll. She combined both in her still photography, snapping pictures at rodeos,
racetracks, music clubs and sports arenas.</p>

<p>From there, she graduated to filmmaking, becoming a camera assistant  (Carroll
Ballard&rsquo;s <strong>The Nutcracker</strong>) and operator (Comedy Central&rsquo;s <strong>Reno 911</strong>)
and eventually a commercial DP and Cinematographer. As a shooter, she&rsquo;s
worked on hundreds of commercials and music videos and is known for her hard
work ethics and passion for a project.</p>

<p>In addition to shooting commercials, Lulus documentary work includes the PBS
mini-series, <strong>The Meaning of Food</strong>, the short film <strong>Seventeen People
from Toronto</strong>, and the Emmy winning PBS short, <strong>The Crossing Guard</strong>.
She has done additional camerawork on <strong>Hype</strong>, <strong>The Jim Rose Sideshow</strong>,
<strong>Pearl Jam</strong> and <strong>Alice in Chains</strong> live concerts.</p>

<p>Among her credits for nonprofit agencies are shoots for the Nisqually Tribe, the
Faith Trust Institute, the United Way and the Committee for Children. <strong>Check It
Out</strong> and <strong>Got 2 Come Up</strong> have both won awards, including regional EMMY's.</p>

<p>Her narrative work includes <strong>The Collectors</strong> (Best Drama LATV FEST), <strong>The
Year of My Japanese Cousin</strong> (PBS drama), and <strong>Spare Me</strong> (SIFF Fly
Film).</p>

<p>When not making films, Lulu has played the guitar as a member of Seattle punk
band, the <strong><a hreflang="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastbacks" target="_blank">Fastbacks</a></strong>. For over 20 years, the Fastbacks have performed
around the US, Japan and Europe, touring with bands such as Pearl Jam and
Presidents of the United States of America.</p>

<p>Lulu is currently is working on the documentary <strong><a href="http://vimeo.com/15371310" target="_blank">Howdy Pardner&mdash;Tales of
the Cowboy Hat</a></strong>, co-produced with director, David Wild.</p>    </div>
