        <strong>Forty-Seven Views of Leslie Laskey</strong> is a documentary film portrait 
        of an artist, teacher and poet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Directed and edited by David Wild, <strong>Forty-Seven Views</strong> intimately 
        chronicles the life of Leslie J. Laskey over an eleven year period. Together with 
        Cinematographer, Lulu Gargiulo the filmmakers spent countless hours to capture Leslie 
        in his everyday life of painting, cooking, walking his dog, entertaining friends, 
        cutting and printing wood blocks and ultimately teaching the people around him 
        to look at the world in new and different ways.  Despite being 90 years old, 
        Leslie&rsquo;s ability to create and inspire, as well as challenge and amuse become 
        evermore apparent with each chapter. 
      </p> 

      <p>
        Watching the film, one gets the idea that for Leslie art, work and life are one 
        and the same. Whether he&rsquo;s talking about baking peaches, sharing his ideas for 
        design or reciting poetry, his passion and energy for life are contagious.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Forty-Seven Views of Leslie Laskey</strong> has &ldquo;bottled&rdquo; the spirit of a 
        truly great artist and human.
